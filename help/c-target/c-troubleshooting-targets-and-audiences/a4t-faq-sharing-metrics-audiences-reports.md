# Share metrics, audiences, and reports - A4T FAQ{#share-metrics-audiences-and-reports-a-t-faq}

This topic contains answers to questions that are frequently asked about sharing metrics, audiences, and reports when using Analytics as the reporting source for Target (A4T).

## How can I curate a report for my users? {#section_24176388591A488C86F972213CD6A123}

Often, you want to create a view of a test for different groups of users to make it easier for them to look at the test results. In Analytics, it is possible to create a bookmark that will save the current view of a report, including metrics, date ranges, segments, and other data.

For more information, see [Bookmark manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/reports-analytics/bookmarks.html).

## How can I make sure metrics and segments are shared with my optimization team? {#section_38BCA134A2F64C21B670CBD4491B7099}

If you are using special metrics and segments with a test, you might consider creating a user group for your optimization team. Share those metrics and segments with the group instead of individual members to make sure they all have access to the segments and metrics. Only Admins can share with groups.

See [Sharing segments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/t-seg-share.html) and [Sharing calculated metrics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/calculated-metrics/calcmetric-workflow/cm-sharing.html).
