# User permission requirements

Information about the user account requirements to create an [!DNL Adobe Analytics]-based activity in [!DNL Adobe Target] (A4T).

Before a report suite can be selected when defining an [!DNL Analytics] activity, you need both an [!DNL Analytics] user account and a [!DNL Target] user account. 

Your user accounts must be configured as described in the following sections:

Complete the following tasks in the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com):

### Link solution accounts to your Adobe ID

Your [!DNL Analytics] and [!DNL Target] user accounts must be linked to your Adobe ID.

### Configure Experience Cloud group membership

You must be a member of one or more [!DNL Experience Cloud] groups that have access to [!DNL Analytics] and [!DNL Target].
