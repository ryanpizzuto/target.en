# Download mbox.js{#download-mbox-js}

Target Standard and Premium use a modified version of the Adobe Target mbox.js file.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>**mbox.js end-of-life**: On March 31, 2021, [!DNL Adobe Target] will no longer support the mbox.js library. Post March 31, 2021, all calls made from mbox.js will gracefully fail and impact your pages that have [!DNL Target] activities running by serving default content.
>
>We recommend that all customers migrate to the most recent version of the new [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK] or the at.js JavaScript library before this date to avoid any potential issues with your sites. For more information, see [Overview: implement Target for client-side web](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/implement-target-for-client-side-web.md).

To use the [!DNL Adobe Target] [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Editor], you must include an additional line of JavaScript as part of your [!DNL mbox.js] file. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Implementation]** in [!DNL Target Standard].
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Download mbox.js]** and follow the prompts to save the file.
1. (Conditional) If you use [!DNL mbox.js] version 60 or later, you can configure the library to automatically hide page content by default until mboxes load to reduce flicker on responsive sites.

   For more information, see "Suppress page-load flicker" in [mbox.js Advanced Settings](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/t-mbox-download/advanced-mboxjs-settings.md#reference_A9C8DAC6DF7743EDBCF1D71F8F20843C). 

1. Create the [!DNL mbox.js] reference on the website.

   Beginning with [!DNL mbox.js] version 57, the [!DNL mbox.js] reference can be placed anywhere within the `<head>` section of the page.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >If you use a version of [!DNL mbox.js] prior to version 57, the reference must be the last item in the `<head>` section of your pages. If the reference is not the last item, serious display or performance issues could result. See [What mbox.js does](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/t-mbox-download/mbox-technical.md) for more information.

1. Upload the saved [!DNL mbox.js] file to the location in your hosting environment that you specified in the code.
