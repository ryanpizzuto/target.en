For example, you can move one or more folders into another folder to create sub-folders. Click [!UICONTROL Clear Selection] to deselect offers or folders you have selected.

## Considerations when deleting items {#delete}

* You can delete an entire folder containing any number of assets and sub-folders inside. This feature is available in the Target UI as well in the Adobe Experience Cloud Assets UI.
* If you delete a folder with a large number of images, the process running behind the scenes can take time (several minutes) before the UI refreshes to show the final state. The amount of time necessary is a function of the number of images, not the size of the images. A good estimate is ten minutes for 2,000 images. You can proceed with other work and check the final state after several minutes to verify the deletion.
* Non-empty folders in the Image Offer library can be deleted. If all images within the folder are not referenced in any activity, the entire folder and its contents are deleted. If some images within the folder are referenced in any activity, all unreferenced images are deleted, but referenced images and folders containing those images are retained.
