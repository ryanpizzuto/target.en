# Offers

Use the [!UICONTROL Offers] library in [!DNL Adobe Target] to manage your code offer and image offer content.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Offers]** to open the library.

   The library contains the offers that have been set up via [!DNL Target Standard/Premium], [!DNL Target Classic], [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] (AEM), [!DNL Adobe Mobile Services] (AMS), and APIs. Offers created in [!DNL Target Classic] or other solutions are editable in [!DNL Target Standard/Premium].

   The [!UICONTROL Offers] page has two tabs along the right side: [!UICONTROL Code Offers] and [!UICONTROL Image Offers] that let you view offers by type.
