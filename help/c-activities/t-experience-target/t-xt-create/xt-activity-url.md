# Activity URL in Experience Targeting (XT) activities

The [!UICONTROL Activity URL] determines the page that is used in the [!DNL Adobe Target] [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting] (XT) activity, and that opens in the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC) or [!UICONTROL Form-Based Experience Composer] when the activity is designed.

1. When prompted while [creating an XT activity](/help/c-activities/t-experience-target/t-xt-create/xt-create.md), specify the activity URL. Type the complete URL (including `https://`), then click **[!UICONTROL Create Activity]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >[!DNL Target] does not differentiate between URL protocols ( [!DNL https] and [!DNL http]). As a result, [!DNL `https://www.adobe.com`] and [!DNL `http://www.adobe.com`] both match.
   >
   >By default, the VEC or Form-Based Experience Composer opens the page that is specified in your [Visual Experience Composer settings](/help/administrating-target/visual-experience-composer-set-up.md). You can specify a different page during activity creation.
   >
   >If you specify a URL for a site that does not include the Target Standard JavaScript code, you cannot select page elements.

1. (Conditional) To display a different page after the VEC opens, click **[!UICONTROL Configure]**, select **[!UICONTROL Page Delivery]**, and specify the URL in the [!UICONTROL URL] field.

   ![Page Delivery dialog box](/help/c-activities/t-experience-target/t-xt-create/assets/url-config-new.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you change the URL after making changes to a page for one or more experiences, the experience is reset using the new page and the changes you made are lost.

1. (Conditional) Click **[!UICONTROL Add Template Rule]** to add more pages or sections to the activity.

   Additional rules can be based on any of the following:

   * URL 
   * Domain 
   * Path 
   * Hash (#) Fragment 
   * Query 
   * mbox Parameter

   Additional rules can be joined to the Activity URL with AND or OR. All rules you add are evaluated against each other with AND.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** when you have finished.
