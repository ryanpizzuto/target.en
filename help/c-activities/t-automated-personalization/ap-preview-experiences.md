# ![PREMIUM](/help/assets/premium.png) Preview experiences for Automated Personalization in the Visual Experience Composer{#preview-experiences-for-automated-personalization-in-the-visual-experience-composer}

Because an [!DNL Adobe Target] [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] (AP) activity compares multiple offers on a page, it is helpful to preview the page with each experience.

1. From the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC), click **[!UICONTROL Preview]**.

   ![Preview icon](/help/c-activities/t-automated-personalization/assets/preview.png)

   A list of all experiences displays.

1. Click a specific experience in the list to view it.

1. (Conditional) To exclude one or more experiences from the activity, click the **[!UICONTROL Exclude]** icon.

   ![Exclude icon](/help/c-activities/t-automated-personalization/assets/ap_exclude-new.png)

   The [!UICONTROL Manage Content] dialog box displays.

   You might choose to exclude an experience that shows conflicting variations or an experience that is not aesthetically balanced.

   To exclude an experience, hover over the experience and click the **[!UICONTROL Exclude]** icon.

   To exclude multiple experiences, select the check boxes for the desired experiences, then click the **[!UICONTROL Exclude]** icon at the top right of the list.

   By default, all experiences are included in the [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] activity. To include an experience that has been excluded, hover over the experience and click the  **[!UICONTROL Include]** icon.

   To include multiple experiences that have been excluded, select the check boxes for the desired experiences, then click the **[!UICONTROL Include]** icon at the top right of the list. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Compose]** to return to the Visual Experience Composer so you can make changes, or click **[!UICONTROL Next]** to go to the [!UICONTROL Targeting] step.
